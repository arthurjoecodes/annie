When Will was 12 his father passed away.
so he never really got to know him especially since his dad worked 20 hours a day.
Because of this, Stacks became a hardworking man that thought relaxing was a waste of time.
Will does have a soft side.
but he never would have found it had not Annie come into his life.
He has a crush on Grace but has an awkward flirting routine. 
I like Will stacks.
Ilove his singing when he sings Who am i.
I loved your voice.
i was singing Who am i the song.
